# Minecraft Origins: Trickster

A minecraft origin made for the Spooncraft Spoonpack Modpack (and for myself). We do a miniscule amount of trolling. A pinch of tomfoolery. A grain of trickery. A teency weency amount of Jestery. A microscopic quantity of sillyness. A minimum amount of fooling around. A teensy quantity of chicanery. A wee bit of buffoonery. A slight, miniature amount of scheming. Occasional rough and tumble. A smidgeon of immature deception. A tiny little silly willy. A plank length of delinquency. A sample of runnery. A sliver of mischief. A modest sum of antics. A tiny fraction of messing around. A modicum of funny business. A tad bit of dubious deeds.
